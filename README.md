Tutorial:
To launch the project you should start 
Spring Boot (run "src/main/java/com/example/ukeesstest/UkeessTestApplication.java") 
and React applications(run command "npm start" in "src/main/webapp/reactjs"),
so now you can access the project with http://localhost:3000/.

Database scheme is in "src/main/resources/db/migration", it will migrate automatically.
Also, you need to set your MySQL credentials in "application.properties":
app.datasource.username=...
app.datasource.password=...
spring.flyway.user=...
spring.flyway.password=...

and have a database named "ukeess_test".
